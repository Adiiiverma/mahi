        <pre>15. “You Understand Me Like No One Else”

                “You just get me in a way that no one else does. 
                I don’t even have to explain myself because you already know what I’m thinking. 
                I’m so grateful to have someone in my life who understands me on such a deep level. 
                You’re not just my best friend—you’re my kindred spirit.”

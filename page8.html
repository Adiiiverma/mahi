        <pre>8. “You Always Know What to Say”

                <br>“One of the things I love most about you is that you always know exactly what to say. Whether <br>I’m going through something tough or just need a little pick-me-up, you always have the perfect <br>words. I’m so lucky to have you in my life, and I hope you know how much your friendship means <br>to me.”

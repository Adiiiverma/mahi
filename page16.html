                “Looking back, I realize that you’ve been there for me during 
                some of the most important moments of my life. 
                You’ve seen me at my best and my worst, and you’ve never judged me or walked away. 
                I’m so thankful for your loyalty and love, and I just wanted to 
                remind you how much you mean to me.”

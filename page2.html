                “I don’t say it enough, but thank you for always being there for me. 
                You’re the one who lifts me up when I’m feeling down, 
                who knows how to make me laugh when I need it most, 
                and who never judges me no matter what. 
                I’m so lucky to have you in my life, and I just wanted to let you know that.”
